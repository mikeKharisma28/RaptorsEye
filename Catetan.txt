Problem statement
1. It gets input from webcam or some folder by loading it
2. Detects faces in the input image
3. Shows these detected faces in the image by marked rectagle

Algorithm used = Viola-Jones Algorithm which is applied in the Haar Cascade

Haar Cascade is a classifier or detector trained on thousands of human faces
  - stored in an XML file

Step-by-step Tutorial
=====================
1. Declaring the classifier
   - Declare an object of class HaarCascade
   
   "private HaarCascade haar;"

2. Load the HaarCascade XML files
